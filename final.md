#### 1) Crosslink

**[Figure 1](http://www.jbc.org/content/290/44/26404.full).** Formaldehyde (*red dots*) reversably crosslinks associated proteins (*blue* and *purple*) and DNA (*black curve*) within the environment of a cell or nucleus. DNA is shown wrapped around nucleosomes (grey circles). **Figure provibed by Hoffman *et al*. The Journal of Biological Chemistry (2015) **

Crosslinking is a reversable process that covalently bonds associated molecules, such as proteins and DNA. In ChIP, we are interested in chromatin and as such, we focus on chromatin-protein interactions. Since chains of associated proteins can be crosslinked together, chromatin-protein-protein-... interactions are also of interest. Common proteins of interest are transcription factors and histones (with specific modifications).

#### 2) Shear DNA

**Figure 2.** DNA is sheared to sequencable length while complexes are conserved.

DNA is sheared to a sequencable length. Crosslinks are strong, so they are not broken in this process. The result is small fragments of chromatin in complex with proteins that associated with that small fragment.
