[Figure 1](http://www.jbc.org/content/290/44/26404.full). Formaldehyde (*red dots*) reversably crosslinks associated proteins (*blue* and *purple*) and DNA (*black curve*) within the environment of a cell or nucleus. DNA is shown wrapped around nucleosomes (grey circles).

Crosslinking is a reversable process that covalently bonds associated molecules, such as proteins and DNA. In ChIP, we are interested in chromatin and as such, we focus on chromatin-protein interactions. Since chains of associated proteins can be crosslinked together, chromatin-protein-protein-... interactions are also of interest.
